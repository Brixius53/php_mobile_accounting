php_mobile_accounting
=====================

A simple Accounting Application for mobile devices and classical computers.
Based on minimalistic coding in PHP and Javascript to enable simple hosting
at a huge amount of shared hosting providers or other LAMP-Servers.
It's written during watching TV, mostly on weekends but I think this fakt
should not be seen to much at reviewing its code. But I invite everybody to
send me comments on identified deficites.

The software is contributed under GPL (see license.txt) in this Folder.

It contains JQuery, JQuery-Mobile and Knockout.js as clientside framework.
On the serverside its code relies just on plain PHP5 (using mysqli for 
database connectivity) with no additional frameworks.
